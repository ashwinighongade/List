# Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples. 
# Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
# Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]


a=[(2,5),(1,2),(4,4),(2,3),(2,1)]
# for i in a:
#     b=i[-1] 
#     c=[]
#     l=0
#     for j in a:
#         # print(j)
#         for k in a:

#             # print(k[1])
#             if k[1]==(b)+l:
#                 c.append(k)
#         l+=1
# # a=[f for f in a if f not in c]
# print(c)
