# Write a Python program to generate a list of numbers in the arithmetic progression starting with the given positive integer and up to the specified limit. Go to the editor
# Sample Output:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
# [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36]
# [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
